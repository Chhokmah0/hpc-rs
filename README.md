# High performance computing in rust

Implement the algorithm in [https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) using Rust.

## Some interesting things now

- Fastest MontgomerySpace implementation
- Cache-oblivious matrix transpose and matrix convolution that are not restricted to square matrices
